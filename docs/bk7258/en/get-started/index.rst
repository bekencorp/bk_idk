This article demonstrates:

 - Armino code and toolchain download
 - Setup software development environment
 - How to configure Armino project
 - How to build the project and flash the bin to board

Preparation
--------------------------------------------------------

Hardware：

 - BK7258 Demo board
 - BKFIL.exe
 - PC（Windows & Ubuntu）

.. note::

  Armino supports compilation on the Linux platform and also supports compilation on the Linux virtual machine on the Windows platform;
  Armino supports firmware burning on Windows/Linux platforms (refer to the guidance document in the burning tool).

Software：

 - GCC ARM tool chain, used to compile BK7258
 - Build tools, including CMake
 - Armino source code
 - BKFIL.exe


Introduction to Development Board
--------------------------------------------------------

Click the following link to learn more about the development boards supported by Armino:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

        BK7258 <bk7258>

Armino SDK Code download
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We can download Armino from gitlab::

    mkdir -p ~/armino
    cd ~/armino
    git clone https://gitlab.bekencorp.com/armino/bk_idk.git


We also can download Armino from github::

	mkdir -p ~/armino
	cd ~/armino
	git clone https://github.com/bekencorp/bk_idk.git


Then switch to the stable branch Tag node, such as v2.0.1.12::

    git checkout -B your_branch_name v2.0.1.12

.. note::

    The gitlab always has the latest Armino code, only authorised account can download the code. Please contact the your BK7258 project owner to get relevant accounts.



Setup Build Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

      The Armino compilation environment requires Ubuntu 20.04 LTS version and above. This chapter will take Ubuntu 20.04 LTS version as an example to introduce the construction of the entire compilation environment.


Tool Chain Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------

Click `Donwload <https://dl.bekencorp.com/tools/toolchain/arm/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2>`_ to download the BK7258 toolchain.

After downloading the tool kit, decompress it to '/opt/'::

    $ sudo tar -xvjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2 -C /opt/


.. note::

    Tool chain the default path is configured in the middleware/soc/bk7258/bk7258.defconfig, you can modify ``CONFIG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH`` to set to your owner toolchain path:

        CONFIG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH="/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/bin"


Depended libraries installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Enter the following command in the terminal to install python3\CMake\Ninja::

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake python3 python3-pip doxygen ninja-build libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libncurses5-dev lib32z1 -y
    sudo pip3 install pycryptodome click

Document Compilation Dependent Library Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click `Doc <https://docs.bekencorp.com/arminodoc/bk_idk/bk7258/zh_CN/v2.0.1/index.html>`_ you can get the latest Armino documents. So you don't need to build the document youself.

If you really need to build the documents, following python3 packages are required::

    sudo pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme future breathe blockdiag sphinxcontrib-seqdiag sphinxcontrib-actdiag sphinxcontrib-nwdiag sphinxcontrib.blockdiag


If you default Python is Python2, please set it to Python3::

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python


Build The Project
------------------------------------

Run following commands to build BK7258 app project::

    cd ~/armino/bk_idk
    make bk7258


The app project startup:

 - WiFi/BLE
 - Common pheripheral driver
 - Armino default Cli


Configuration project
------------------------------------

We can also use the project configuration file for differentiated configuration::

    Project Profile Override Chip Profile Override Default Configuration
    Example： bk7258/config >> bk7258.defconfig >> KConfig
    + Example of project configuration file：
        projects/app/config/bk7258/config
    + Sample chip configuration file：
        middleware/soc/bk7258/bk7258.defconfig
    + Sample KConfig configuration file：
        middleware/arch/cm33/Kconfig
        components/bk_cli/Kconfig

- Modules Excutes In Which CPUx

    + At present, BK7258 is a three-core AMP system architecture. The software of CPU0, CPU1, and CPU2 is compiled independently, but the SDK is a set, so some functional differences between CPU0, CPU1, and CPU2 need to be distinguished using macros.
    + For example, there is only one copy of the TRNG random number controller. When using multi-core configuration, the application needs to be mutually exclusive in which system (CPU0/CPU1/CPU2) it is executed.
    + The module's function switch CONFIG_TRNG macro is turned off by default. Whichever CPU needs it, it can be turned on in the chip configuration file of that CPU.
      Assuming that CPU0 needs to use TRNG and CPU1 does not need to use it, then CONFIG_TRNG=y in bk7258.defconfig.
    + In software code, use the CONFIG_TRNG macro to isolate calls.


    + Example codes::

         #if CONFIG_TRNG             #Uses module macro to seperate CPUx software whether enable TRNG
         #include "driver/trng.h"
         #endif
         ...
         #if CONFIG_TRNG             #Uses module macro to seperate CPUx software whether enable TRNG
         bk_rand();
         #endif

New project
------------------------------------

The default project is projects/app. For new projects, please refer to projects/app project


Burn Code
------------------------------------

On the Windows platform, Armino currently supports UART burning.



Burn through serial port
****************************************

.. note::

    Armino supports UART burning. It is recommended to use the CH340 serial port tool board to download.

Serial port burning tool is shown in the figure below:

    :figclass: align-center

    UART

Download burning tools (BKFILL.exe)：

	http://dl.bekencorp.com/tools/flash/
	Get the latest version in this directory. Ex：BEKEN_BKFIL_V2.1.6.0_20231123.zip

Burn the serial port DL_UART0, click ``Download`` to burn the image, and then power down and restart the device after burning.


Serial port Log and Command Line
------------------------------------

Currently the BK7258 use the DL_UART0 as the Log output and Cli input; You can get the supported command list through the help command.
