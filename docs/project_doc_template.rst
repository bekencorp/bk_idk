=====================

Overview
--------------------

*What is this project? What does it do?*

*What features of Armino does it use?*

*What could someone create based on this project? ie applications/use cases/etc*

*If there are any acronyms or Beken-only words used here, explain them or mention where in the datasheet this information can be found.*


Hardware Requirements
-------------------------------

*If possible, project should be able to run on any commonly available Beken development board. Otherwise, describe what specific hardware should be used.*

*If any other items (server, BLE device, app, second chip, whatever) are needed, mention them here. Include links if applicable. Explain how to set them up.*

Configure and Build
-------------------------------

Flash
***************************

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use Armino to build projects.

Configure OTP/eFuse

*If there is any OTP/eFuse that the user must configured for this project, mention this here. Otherwise, remove this section.*

Running and Output - *Case Name*
----------------------------------------

*If the project support different use case, describe each one in a separate section. Otherwise the Case Name can be removed.*

Operate
***********************************

*If the user is supposed to interact with the project at this point (input CLI commands, press button, send HTTP request, etc. then mention it here)*
*For projects where Beken chip is connected with some other hardware, include a table or schematics with connection details.*

Output
**********************************

*Include an project of the console output from the running project, here:*

 Paste the output here.

Troubleshooting
--------------------------

*If there are any likely problems or errors which many users might encounter, mention them here. Remove this section for very simple projects where nothing is likely to go wrong.*

Project Breakdown
--------------------------

*If the project source code is lengthy, complex, or cannot be easily understood, use this section to break down and explain the source code. This can be done by breaking down the execution path step by step, or explaining what each major function/task/source file does. Add sub titles if necessary. Remove this section for very simple projects where the source code is self explanatory.*
