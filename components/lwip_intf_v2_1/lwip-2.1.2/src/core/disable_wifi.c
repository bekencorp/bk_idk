 * deallocated.
 *
 * For a pbuf chain, this is repeated for each pbuf in the chain,
 * up to the first pbuf which has a non-zero reference count after
 * decrementing. So, when all reference counts are one, the whole
 * chain is free'd.
 *
 * @param p The pbuf (chain) to be dereferenced.
 *
 * @return the number of pbufs that were de-allocated
 * from the head of the chain.
 *
 * @note MUST NOT be called on a packet queue (Not verified to work yet).
 * @note the reference counter of a pbuf equals the number of pointers
 * that refer to the pbuf (or into the pbuf).
 *
 * @internal examples:
 *
 * Assuming existing chains a->b->c with the following reference
 * counts, calling pbuf_free(a) results in:
 *
 * 1->2->3 becomes ...1->3
 * 3->3->3 becomes 2->3->3
 * 1->1->2 becomes ......1
 * 2->1->1 becomes 1->1->1
 * 1->1->1 becomes .......
