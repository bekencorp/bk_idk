.. _project_set_components:

Build Specific Components
=============================

Overview
-----------------------------

You can set COMPONENTS in the top-level CMakeLists.txt of the project to build only specific components.In the example, only c3_contain_main and dependent components are built::

        cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
        set(COMPONENTS c3_contain_main)
        include($ENV{ARMINO_PATH}/tools/build_tools/cmake/project.cmake)
        project(myProject)

Noticeï¼š

 - All components and dependencies in the COMPONENTS list will be built.
 - Since all components depend on the common component, the common component is also built.
 - The ``main()`` function implementation must be included in the build component.
